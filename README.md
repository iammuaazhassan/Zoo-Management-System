## Overview
The Animal Health Tracking System helps to monitor and maintain records of animals' health, including vaccination status and health updates. The project is designed for efficiency, allowing for easy data input, updates, and retrieval through a structured set of classes.

## Features
- **Animal Data Management**: Keep track of individual animal details.
- **Health Record Tracking**: Store and update health-related data for animals.
- **Vaccination Scheduling**: Record and manage vaccination dates.

## Class Structure

### `Animal`
The `Animal` class manages basic details about each animal, such as its name, ID, and general characteristics.

### `Animal_health`
The `Animal_health` class stores health information related to each animal, including vaccination status and any health history.

### `Date`
The `Date` class helps manage date-related information, crucial for tracking vaccination schedules and health record timelines.

## Usage
To use this system, compile the C++ files and run the executable. The program will prompt for animal information, health updates, and vaccination dates, which are then processed and stored.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/animal-health-tracker.git
cd animal-health-tracker
g++ Animal.cpp Animal_health.cpp date.cpp -o AnimalHealthTracker

./AnimalHealthTracker
